Get Available Times
----------------

**Resources**

Get all available times
``` 
GET /businesses/:business_id/practitioners/:practitioner_id/appointment_types/:appointment_type_id/available_times?from=DATE&to=DATE 
```

**Required Parameters**

There are two parameters required, these form the time frame of available times requested:
* `from` the start date of the time frame (search starts from the beginning of that day in the cliniko account's time zone) 
* `to`   the end date of the time frame (search ends at the end of that day in the cliniko account's time zone)

`from` and `to` cannot be more than 7 days apart (ie. the maximum time period you can request is 7 days) 

`from` and `to` cannot be older than the current date in the cliniko account's time zone.

If one of these parameters is missing or incorrect you will receive bad request error (code 400) with following message:

```shell
Invalid time frame definition. Please check from/to param limitations.
```
