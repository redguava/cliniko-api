Filtering Invoice Items
----------------

For any route that returns a set of invoice items, you can filter them by:
* ```created_at``` DateTime
* ```id``` Integer
* ```invoice_id``` Integer
* ```updated_at``` DateTime

See [Filtering Results](https://github.com/redguava/cliniko-api#filtering-results) for details on how to apply filters.
